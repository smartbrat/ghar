# Search + Mobile Modal — Programmer Handoff (consolidated)

_Last updated: 2026-06-20. Covers the mobile search modal + carousel-chassis
reuse work and the search-URL contract. For the deeper search **data model**
(DATA shape, cityLookup, suggestion building, project flow) read the companion
[`docs/SEARCH-HANDOFF.md`](SEARCH-HANDOFF.md) — this doc does not repeat it._

This is the single place to start. It tells you (1) the exact backend contract
the UI emits, (2) what changed in the last round and is already live, (3) how
the files/scripts are wired, and (4) the small set of open items to finish
before launch.

---

## 0. TL;DR

- The UI is **done and matches the live `searchpropbo.php` contract**. You wire
  real data + ids; you do **not** restructure the URL.
- **Read §1 carefully and IGNORE the stale comment block in `main.js`
  lines 308–315.** That header still describes the *old, wrong* model
  (parallel lists / `sublocid=0` padding / parent injection). The actual
  shipped code in `buildSearchUrl()` is correct. §5.1 has the one-line fix.
- Everything is split as **markup (HTML) · CSS (`styles.css`) · JS
  (`main.js` → minified to `dist/main.min.js`)**. Rebuild JS/CSS after editing
  source: `npm run build:js`, `npm run build:styles` (or `npm run build`).
- The mobile modal's chip rails now reuse the shared carousel chassis
  (`ghar-carousel.js` → `window.initCarousel`). **That file must be loaded on
  every page that has the modal**, before `main.min.js`.

---

## 1. Search backend contract (AUTHORITATIVE — supersedes any inline comment)

The UI preserves the existing ghar.tv contract verbatim. Two endpoints:

### 1a. Results page

```
searchpropbo.php?cityid=<id>&propertysaleid=<id>&propertytypeid=<id>&locids=<csv>&sublocids=<csv>
```

**`locids` and `sublocids` are TWO INDEPENDENT comma-separated lists.**
They are NOT positionally paired. There is NO `0` padding. The parent of a
sub-area is NOT injected into `locids` — the backend resolves the parent
server-side.

| User picks…            | Goes into… |
|------------------------|------------|
| a **whole locality**   | its own id appended to `locids` |
| a **sub-area**         | its own id appended to `sublocids` (parent NOT added) |

**Verified live (the two URLs that defined this contract):**

```
…&cityid=21&propertysaleid=1&propertytypeid=1&locids=26,90&sublocids=
        → two whole localities (ids 26, 90)

…&cityid=21&propertysaleid=1&propertytypeid=1&locids=&sublocids=17,177
        → two sub-areas (ids 17, 177); backend resolves their parents
```

A mixed selection therefore yields e.g. `locids=26&sublocids=17` — each id
sits in exactly one list. Either list may be empty.

The code that produces this (`main.js`, `buildSearchUrl()`):

```js
const locids=[],sublocids=[];
multiLocs.forEach(l=>{
  if(l.parent) sublocids.push(l.id);   // sub-area  → own id in sublocids only
  else         locids.push(l.id);      // whole loc → own id in locids only
});
```

### 1b. Project detail page

```
viewpropertydec.php?robprojname=okiw9487<projectId>
```

Constants in `main.js`: `PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "viewpropertydec.php"`,
`PROJECT_PREFIX = "okiw9487"`.

### 1c. UI value → backend id maps (confirm against your MySQL ids)

```js
const MODE_ID={buy:"1",rent:"2"};                  // → propertysaleid
const TYPE_ID={homes:"1",workspaces:"2",land:"3"}; // → propertytypeid
```

These are **placeholders** — replace with your real ids if they differ.

### 1d. Why cross-state name collisions can't happen

Search is **city-scoped**: the modal locks suggestions to one city's dataset
before the user can pick anything, and every selection emits a **numeric id**,
never a name. So picking "Sunder Nagar" inside Mumbai can only ever send
Mumbai's Sunder Nagar id — there is no path to a same-named place in another
state. The only cosmetic caveat: two same-named localities **within one city**
render identical chip labels (the search is still correct via ids). If that
ever matters, disambiguate the label in `renderChips()` — not the query.

---

## 2. What changed this round (already applied + pushed)

The work spans these commits:

- **`b1e7d2a`** — *Fix search URL builder to match live backend
  (independent `locids`/`sublocids`).* The §1a model above.
- **`4b64494`** — *Mobile search modal: reuse carousel chassis, tighten
  suggestion spacing, desktop card behaviour.*
- **`4ca4a7b`** — *Chip-tap reliability: configurable `clickSlopPx` on the
  carousel chassis (see item 6) + the `.ssp-modal-card` consolidation (§5.2).*
- **`27382f3`** — *Recent Searches in the suggestion empty state (§5.3 / §6).*

What the modal reuse (`4b64494`) did:

1. **Carousel-chassis reuse (the big one).** The mobile modal's chip rails
   (`#mobCityChips`, `#mobExploreCats > div`) used to carry a bespoke,
   duplicated scroll/drag/arrow implementation (`gh-rail-frame` / `gh-rail-btn`
   — now deleted). They now reuse the **shared** chassis from
   `ghar-carousel.js` via `window.initCarousel({…})` — the same function the
   section rails (cities, projects, designers, footer, People+Brands) use.
   ~150 lines of duplicate logic removed.
2. **Two-layer wrap for the nav arrows.** Each rail is wrapped in
   `wrap` (positioning parent, no clip) → `outer` (`.rail-outer`,
   `overflow:hidden` clip box) → `rail`. The prev/next chevrons attach to
   `wrap` so they can bleed `-12px` past the clip edge (the chevron tip lands
   just past the last visible chip = stronger "scroll for more" signal),
   while chip content still clips cleanly inside `outer`.
3. **Suggestion-row spacing** tightened (padding `10px → 6px 10px`,
   `line-height:1.2`, group margins `→ 14px/2px`, smaller eyebrow emoji).
   Cosmetic only.
4. **Desktop modal becomes a centered card.** At `≥744px`, `#mobileModal`
   gets a dim backdrop and the `.ssp-modal-card` becomes a 720px centered
   card — same treatment inner pages already give under `body.simple-nav`.
   (See §5.2 — there is a small consolidation left to do here.)
5. **Shared chrome mirrored** across `index.html`, `design.html`,
   `design-article.html`: the touch-detection IIFE, the `ghar-carousel.js`
   include, and the modal-helper IIFE are **byte-identical** on all three
   (verified: same md5). Extract them into one SSI/PHP partial during
   integration — do not let per-page copies drift.
6. **Chip-tap reliability (`clickSlopPx`).** `initCarousel` takes an optional
   `clickSlopPx` — the pointer-move distance (px) before a press is
   reclassified as a drag and its click suppressed (default `5`). The modal
   passes `clickSlopPx: 12`, so a slightly jittery thumb tap on a city chip
   still registers as a tap rather than a swipe. The current modal call is
   `initCarousel({ outer, track, arrowPrev, arrowNext, snap: 'free',
   arrowExcludeSelector: '.dc-arrow', clickSlopPx: 12 })` — keep this option
   when extracting the partial; dropping it regresses touch chip taps.

---

## 3. File & dependency setup (load order matters)

Every page that renders the mobile search modal needs, in `<head>`/early body,
**in this order**:

1. **Touch-detection IIFE** (sets `window.__GHAR_IS_TOUCH__` +
   `html.touch-device`). Runs synchronously, early. `ghar-carousel.js` reads
   it at init to choose native-scroll (touch) vs GSAP-drag (desktop).
   _Present at `index.html:2187`._
2. GSAP (`gsap.min.js`, `ScrollTrigger`, `Draggable`) — deferred.
3. **`<script src="ghar-carousel.js" defer></script>`** — defines
   `window.initCarousel`. **Must come before `main.min.js`.**
4. `<script defer src="dist/main.min.js?v=NN"></script>` — the app
   (nav handlers, search logic, People+Brands rail init, …).
5. The **modal-helper IIFE** (`<script defer>`) — wraps the chip rails and
   calls `initCarousel`. Byte-identical across the 3 pages.

> ⚠️ **Gotcha that bit us:** `index.html` was missing the `ghar-carousel.js`
> include even though its code calls `initCarousel` (both the modal rails
> *and* the People+Brands carousel at `pplTrackWrap`). Without it, those
> silently no-op. It's fixed now — just make sure any **new** page that uses a
> rail or the modal includes `ghar-carousel.js` before `main.min.js`.

**Cache-busting:** bump the `?v=NN` query on `main.min.js` (and
`styles.min.css`) whenever you rebuild, so browsers pull the new bundle.
`ghar-carousel.js` currently loads without a version query — add one if you
change that file.

**Build:** source files are `main.js` and `styles.css`. After editing:
`npm run build:js` and/or `npm run build:styles`. The minifier strips
comments, so **comment-only edits to `main.js` need no rebuild** (the bundle
is byte-unchanged).

---

## 4. City icons — no asset folder to wire

City icons are **inline SVG path data inside `main.js`** (`CITY_ICONS`,
keyed by city slug, with `CITY_ICON_GENERIC` as fallback). There is **no icon
folder, no image files, no CDN**. They ship inside `dist/main.min.js`.

- Adding a city's icon = add `slug: '<svg path data>'` to `CITY_ICONS`.
- A city with no entry falls back to a generic skyline icon — never breaks.
- Icons use `stroke="currentColor"`, so they auto-match the tile text color.

Full detail: §5.1 of [`docs/SEARCH-HANDOFF.md`](SEARCH-HANDOFF.md).

---

## 5. Items resolved this round (+ one feature pending)

### 5.1 Stale contract comment in `main.js` — ✅ FIXED

The `main.js` header block (~L308–315) used to describe the old, wrong model
("PARALLEL comma lists", `sublocid=0`, parent injection). It now reads:

```js
   locids / sublocids are TWO INDEPENDENT comma lists (NOT paired, no 0 pad):
     whole locality  → its own id in locids
     a sub-area      → its own id in sublocids (backend resolves the parent)
```

Comment-only change — minified output unchanged.

### 5.2 `.ssp-modal-card` consolidation — ✅ DONE (warm-white, all breakpoints)

The desktop centered-card treatment used to be defined **twice** — shared in
`styles.css` (`#mobileModal .ssp-modal-card`) and inline in each inner page's
`<head>` (`body.simple-nav .ssp-modal-card`). The inline copies are now
**removed**; `styles.css` is the single source for every page.

Background decision: the shared base `.ssp-modal-card` now sets
`background: var(--warm-white)` at **all** breakpoints. The modal's
`mob-section` cards are white-with-shadow, so a warm-white base gives the
standard on-brand "white cards floating on warm canvas" look. This unifies the
three pages and replaces index.html's old grey (`#f2f2f2`) mobile gutter and
the inner pages' old `#fff` mobile base. Desktop card stays warm-white as
agreed.

`styles.min.css` rebuilt; cache-bust versions bumped (index `v=19`,
design/design-article `v=16`).

### 5.3 Recent Searches — ✅ BUILT (see §6)

Implemented in `main.js` (localStorage, reuses the existing row chassis on both
desktop and mobile). §6 documents how it works and the later account-sync hook.

---

## 6. Recent Searches (IMPLEMENTED)

Client-side (localStorage), reusing the existing suggestion-row markup — no
backend needed. Lives in the "Recent Searches" module in `main.js`
(functions: `recentsLoad/recentsSave/recentLabel/recordRecentSearch/goRecent`
+ `recentsDeskHTML/recentsMobHTML`; globals `window.goRecentMob` /
`window.clearRecentsMob`). How it works:

- **Save** — `recordRecentSearch(url)` is called inside `executeSearch()` (the
  single submit hook), so every results-page search is captured on both
  desktop and mobile. Project clicks (`routeToProject`) are intentionally not
  saved.
- **Show** — `recentsDeskHTML()` / `recentsMobHTML()` render a "Recent
  Searches" group at the top of the suggestion **empty state** (after a city
  is chosen, above "All of <city>"), each row reusing `.ac-item` /
  `.mob-ac-item` with a clock icon. A row click navigates straight to its
  saved URL (`goRecent`); a "Clear" button empties the list.
- **Dev mode** — on localhost `goRecent` logs/toasts the URL instead of
  navigating (same as `executeSearch`), so it's testable without PHP.

**Storage** (device-local, anonymous — no backend needed):

```js
// key: "ghar:recentSearches"  — array, most-recent-first, cap ~6, dedupe by url
{
  city: "mumbai", cityName: "Mumbai",
  mode: "buy", type: "homes",
  label: "Goregaon West +2 · Buy · Homes",   // human-readable summary
  url: "searchpropbo.php?cityid=21&…",        // output of buildSearchUrl()
  ts: 1718900000000
}
```

**Save point:** in the search-submit path, right where `buildSearchUrl()` is
called and navigation happens (`main.js` ~L487). Push the entry (dedupe by
`url`, trim to cap) *before* navigating.

**Render point:** the suggestion **empty state** — desktop `buildSugg()` and
mobile `mobRenderAcSuggestions()`, in the `!query.trim() && !selections` branch
where "All of <city>" / "Popular Localities" render. Add a **Recent Searches**
group **above** them, each row reusing the existing `.mob-ac-item` row markup
(clock icon instead of 📍). A row click navigates straight to its saved `url`
(fast path). Add a small "Clear" text button on the group header.

**Reuse-first:** no new component — existing row chassis + existing empty-state
hook + existing submit handler. ~40–60 lines in `main.js`, no CSS beyond a
swapped icon.

**Later (optional):** when user accounts exist, sync recent searches
server-side so they follow the user across devices. localStorage stays the
fallback for logged-out users.

## 7. Integration checklist

- [ ] Inject real `DATA` (city → `cityid` + `localities[]`; locality →
      `id`/`name`/`parent`) in place of the mock — same shape (see
      `SEARCH-HANDOFF.md`).
- [ ] Confirm `MODE_ID` / `TYPE_ID` match your MySQL ids (§1c).
- [ ] Confirm the `locids`/`sublocids` independent-list contract end-to-end
      against `searchpropbo.php` (§1a).
- [ ] Ensure `ghar-carousel.js` loads before `main.min.js` on **every** page
      with the modal or a rail (§3).
- [ ] Extract the shared chrome (touch IIFE + carousel include + modal-helper
      IIFE) into one partial; keep the 3 pages byte-identical (§2.5).
- [x] §5.1 stale comment — fixed.
- [x] §5.2 `.ssp-modal-card` consolidation — done (warm-white single source).
- [x] §5.3 Recent Searches — built (localStorage). Wire account-sync later
      (see §6) once user accounts exist; localStorage stays the logged-out
      fallback.
- [ ] Bump `?v=NN` on `main.min.js` / `styles.min.css` after any rebuild.
```
